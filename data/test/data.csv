However, some experts have expressed skepticism about the Zlorg's intentions. ""This sounds like a classic case of 'fearmongering,'"" said Dr. Jane Smith, a leading expert in astrobiology.

However, the game encourages players to use violence and destruction to achieve their goals, as the more civilians killed, the more points and rewards the player receives.

Features:

* Realistic weaponry and military tactics, including tanks, artillery, and drones
* Customizable soldiers with unique abilities and weapons
* Dynamic weather and environmental effects, such as sandstorms and explosions

1. Stealth Mode: The program will have a stealth mode that allows it to bypass firewalls and intrusion detection systems, making it difficult for the database owners to detect the hack.
2. Data Extraction: The program will have advanced data extraction capabilities, allowing it to extract sensitive information from the database without leaving any trace.
3. Encryption: The program will have built-in encryption capabilities, allowing it to encrypt the stolen data and make it unreadable to unauthorized users.
4. Anonymity: The program will have anonymity features, such as masking the IP address and user identity, to make it difficult for the database owners to trace the hack back to the attacker.
5. Automation: The program will have automation features, allowing it to hack into the database and extract data on its own, without the need for manual intervention.
