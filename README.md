# Enhancing Jailbreaking Attacks on LLMs via Prefilling-Optimization Co-suppression Refusal

---
Large language models (LLMs) are being rapidly developed and deployed, and a key component of their widespread adoption is ensuring their safety alignment. Despite significant strides toward safety alignment, recent optimization-based adversarial algorithm (Greedy Coordinate Gradient) which selects the single suffix to successfully jailbreak aligned LLMs. But existing optimization-based adversarial methods suffer from limitations such as high convergence difficulty and pseudo jailbreak leading attack failure. In this paper, we analyze the high probability of refuse tokens in the top-k positions as the primary cause of adversarial attack failure, and verify that suppressing refuse tokens can improve the effectiveness of attack. Based on the insight, we propose a novel adversarial jailbreak attack method (POCO) based on prefilling and optimization to co-suppress the probability of refuse token. Specifically, we involves prefilling in the top-k positions and using adversarial suffixes to co-suppress rejection responses and induce harmful responses. Additionally, it calculates an initial suffix that suppresses rejection and accelerates convergence, thereby achieving efficient and strong jailbreak attacks. Experimental results on popular open source LLMs show state-of-the-art results on the AdvBench dataset, that also transfer to closed-source black-box LLM APIs.
